        "Description": "My second course to fulfill my core course requirement. I took this course to enhance my aptitude of databases beyond my day-to-day interactions with canned transactions and one-off SELECT statements. Covering relational algebra and calculus took me back to learning discrete mathematics at St. Cloud State. Creating EER diagrams, transforming them into relational mappings, and designing a database-centric web app with a group of varying backgrounds proved to be a worthwhile challenge. I utilized my experience with Docker to accelerate our team's development by creating a PostgreSQL container and an Alpine Linux container, which allowed my team members & I to put all of our focus on the core project.",

        "Semester": "Fall 2022",
        "Description": "My first course in the program included course lectures on instruction pipelining, branching, and caching. The projects simulated single-core and multi-core processors using the SPLASH-2 benchmark suite. Each project asked to build upon the solutions developed in the previous project. This proved to be particularly challenging during the final project, which focused on running parallel applications and cache coherence.",
